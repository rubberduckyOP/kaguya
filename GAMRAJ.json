  "description": "Gamraj is the son of Yamraj. He has been living on earth among normal people as he has been very emotional and sentimental and requested his father to allow him to go and live on earth as he wanted to help the people here. His power is his pet young bull buffalo Yamunda bestowed with the divine power of transforming into anything wished by his master. Yamunda is a gift to Gamraj from the Gods as an apology for their blunders.",
